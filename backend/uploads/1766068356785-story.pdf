The night train arrived at Platform Seven without announcement, sliding in like a secret. Most stations slept at that hour, but Mira was awake, sitting on a cold metal bench with her hands wrapped around a paper cup of tea that had long gone bitter. She wasn’t waiting for the train; she was waiting for permission—from herself—to leave.

The station smelled of oil and rain. Above her, a cracked digital board flickered, unsure of the time. Mira checked her phone again, even though she knew there would be no new messages. She had already read the last one too many times: Do what makes you feel alive. It was signed with her father’s name, sent three days before his voice fell silent forever.

When the train doors opened, a handful of passengers stepped out. No one rushed in. The conductor glanced at Mira, then away, as if he understood hesitation too well to interrupt it. She thought about the small apartment she’d locked behind her, the job she’d resigned from that morning, and the life that had felt like borrowed clothing—never quite fitting, always tight around the chest.

Her father had loved trains. He used to say they were proof that leaving didn’t always mean abandoning something; sometimes it meant arriving somewhere else. As a child, Mira believed every train led to adventure. As an adult, she learned how fear could make even open doors look like walls.

The rain outside thickened, drumming softly on the station roof. Mira stood, heart racing, and walked toward the train. Each step felt heavier than the last, as if doubt itself had weight. At the door, she stopped. Her reflection stared back at her in the dark glass—tired eyes, tense shoulders, a life paused mid-breath.

“Going somewhere important?” the conductor asked kindly.

She almost said no. Almost turned back to the bench, to the familiar ache of staying. Instead, she inhaled and nodded. “I think so.”

The conductor smiled and stepped aside. Mira boarded the train.

Inside, the carriage was warm and dimly lit. A woman slept by the window, a suitcase clutched like a promise. A student read notes with fierce concentration. Ordinary people, carrying invisible reasons for moving forward. Mira found an empty seat and sat down, her pulse slowly settling.

The train lurched, then began to move. Platform Seven slid past, then disappeared entirely. Mira pressed her forehead against the window and felt something loosen inside her. Grief was still there, heavy and real, but beneath it was something new—space.

She took out her phone and typed a note she would never send: I’m scared, but I’m going anyway. Then she smiled, softly, through tears.

The train cut through the dark, carrying Mira toward a place she didn’t yet know. For the first time in a long while, that uncertainty felt less like loss and more like hope.
